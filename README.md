# Welcome to India GeoCoder!
**India GoeCoder** is a plugin on _QGIS 3_ to help users geocode health data from NRHM website (https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/hmisreports/frmstandard_reports.aspx) and later visualise the same by displaying data on a map and exporting the map in the form of an image.

This plugin is developed specifically for Indian health data collected by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India under the digital initiative of National Health Mission. The data is released under **Health Management Information System** and is openly available at NRHM (National Rural Health Mission) website: https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/hmisreports/frmstandard_reports.aspx. This data comprises of around *200* health indicators collected across over *5,000* sub districts.

This directory should be given as input in the first dialog while ***Loading and Joining Data***. A folder containing sample health data for district is given in the repository for reference and testing purposes. User may use *this* as the input directory discussed above.
